## 🎮 Game Overview

Run your own shop! Purchase products, set prices strategically, serve customers within time limits, and upgrade your profit margins through timed mechanics. Balance pricing strategy with customer satisfaction to build your coin reserves.

### Core Gameplay
1. **Purchase Products** - Buy inventory from the catalog
2. **Set Prices** - Adjust selling prices within profit margin caps
3. **Serve Customers** - Process orders before patience runs out
4. **Upgrade Margins** - Unlock higher profit caps through timed upgrades
5. **Restock Inventory** - Keep shelves stocked to avoid missed sales

## ✨ Key Features

### 📦 Inventory Management
- **Add Products**: Purchase from a catalog of 6 different products with varying rarities (common, uncommon, rare)
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Set custom prices with profit margin caps (starting at 50%)
- **Stock Tracking**: Monitor inventory levels and restock when needed
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded alerts for low stock (≤10) and out-of-stock items

### 👥 Smart Customer System
- **Intelligent Shopping Lists**: Customers generate 1-3 item orders based on:
  - **Price Sensitivity**: Lower prices = higher selection probability (90% at base cost, 10% at 100%+ markup)
  - **Stock Availability**: Items with more stock have slight visibility boost
  - **Weighted Algorithm**: Realistic customer behavior that mimics real-world shopping patterns
- **Patience Mechanic**: Each customer has their own Patience time - complete orders or lose the sale
- **No Stock Orders**: Customers only request items that are in stock

### 💰 Billing & Memory Challenge
- **Memory Challenge**: Player must memorize customer's order and bill correctly
- **Exact Match Validation**: Orders must match customer requests exactly (items + quantities)
- **Instant Feedback**: 
  - ✅ Success: Earn coins, inventory reduced
  - ❌ Failure: Customer leaves, no sale

### 📈 Profit Upgrade System
- **Variable Increments**: Choose upgrade percentage (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%)
- **Dynamic Costs**: Higher increments cost more coins
- **Timed Unlocks**: Wait for timer completion
- **Strategic Depth**: Balance upgrade costs vs potential profit gains

### 🎯 Restocking System
- **Unified Catalog View**: Add new products or restock existing ones from same modal
- **Smart Button States**:
  - "Add to Inventory" for new products
  - "Buy More Stock" for items with stock
  - "Restock Now" (urgent red) for out-of-stock items
- **Visual Stock Indicators**: Color-coded borders and stock displays

## 🧮 Key Algorithms

### 1. Customer Price Sensitivity
```javascript
calculateAttractiveness(item) {
  const profitMargin = (item.price - item.baseCost) / item.baseCost;
  
  // Base chance: 90% at 0% margin, decreases as margin increases
  let baseChance = 90 - profitMargin * 80;
  baseChance = Math.max(10, Math.min(90, baseChance)); // Clamp 10-90%
  
  // Stock bonus: more stock = slightly higher visibility
  const stockBonus = Math.min(item.stock / 20, 1.2); // Max +20%
  
  return baseChance * stockBonus;
}
```

**Example Probabilities:**
- Item at base cost (0% markup): 90% chance
- Item at +25% markup: 70% chance
- Item at +50% markup: 50% chance
- Item at +100% markup: 10% chance (floor)

### 2. Weighted Random Selection
```javascript
selectWeightedItem(itemsWithWeights) {
  const totalWeight = items.reduce((sum, entry) => sum + entry.weight, 0);
  let random = Math.random() * totalWeight;
  
  for (const entry of items) {
    random -= entry.weight;
    if (random <= 0) return entry.item;
  }
}
```

### 3. Upgrade Cost Formula
- **Cost**: `incrementPercent² × 5`
- **Duration**: `incrementPercent × 2` seconds

**Examples:**
- 10% increment: 500 coins, 20 seconds
- 20% increment: 2000 coins, 40 seconds
- 30% increment: 4500 coins, 60 seconds
- 50% increment: 12500 coins, 100 seconds

### 4. Order Validation
```javascript
validateOrder(cart, customerItems) {
  if (cart.length !== customerItems.length) return false;
  
  return customerItems.every(custItem => {
    const cartItem = cart.find(c => c.inventoryId === custItem.inventoryId);
    return cartItem && cartItem.qty === custItem.qty;
  });
}
```

## 🎯 Gameplay Tips

### Pricing Strategy
- **Loss Leaders**: Price some items at low margins (10-20%) to attract customers
- **Premium Items**: High-margin items (80-100%) for max profit when sold
- **Sweet Spot**: 30-50% margins balance volume and profit
- **Monitor Trends**: If items aren't selling, lower prices

### Time Management
- Upgrade profit margins during slow periods
- Process orders quickly to serve more customers
- Restock before running out to avoid missed sales

### Upgrade Strategy
- Start with small increments (10-20%) for quick wins
- Save coins for larger upgrades (40-50%) on best-selling items
- Prioritize upgrades on low-margin products first

### Memory Challenge Tips
- Focus on item names and quantities
- Use associations (e.g., "3 apples, 2 milk" = "3 fruits, 2 dairy")
- Build cart systematically (same order as customer listed)
